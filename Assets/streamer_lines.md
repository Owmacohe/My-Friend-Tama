## Starting the game

What’s up chatters! Welcome to this week’s instalment of Explore’R’Us, the urban exploration livestream where we check out totally radical abandoned malls! Oh yeah! Today’s lucky find is the Nest Family Shopping Centre, shut down eight years ago due to financial mismanagement, this place is totally *up our alley*. Let’s get exploring!
