## Starting the game

What’s up chatters! Welcome to this week’s instalment of Explore’R’Us, the urban exploration livestream where we check out totally radical abandoned malls! Oh yeah! Today’s lucky find is the Nest Family Shopping Centre, shut down eight years ago due to financial mismanagement, this place is totally *up our alley*. And it even looks like the power’s still left on. Let’s get exploring!



## Seeing the tama

Whoa, what’s that? Is that what I think it is?



## Evolving the tama (first time)

*Oh my goodness* chat, I can’t believe what we have on our hands here. This is real-life, authentic Tama toy! They discontinued these years ago! Radical!



## Seeing the food court

Oh hey, this must be the food court. How cool that! Huh, looks like it was left in a hurry, chat.



## Evolving the tama (second time)

I mean, I guess let’s evolve this thing again. I’m getting kinda freaked out here guys... Haha just kidding! I’m great! Hope you’re all having a fantastic time! Oh yeah!



## Seeing the arcade

Let’s gooo! It’s an arcade! Is that a coin? Let’s go pick it up, chat.



## Evolving the tama (third time)

It keeps bringing me back here... sorta weird huh?.. Let’s keep going I guess.



## Seeing the bathroom

Oh no, no no no. I don’t want to go in there. But... it really wants me to. I guess I have to. *Radical, chat!*



## Dying
